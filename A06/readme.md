## Assignment 6 ##

### Classes, Objects and Methods ###
The point of this assignment is to cover a few of the basic principles of classes and objects including the
proper use of methods.
 
This code is an introduction to creating objects and passing arguments to those objects. We will cover
much of this in detail later in the course; however, take this opportunity to study the code and
determine what is going on.

### Problem ###
Add the constructor for the Car class and add the accessor (getters and setters) methods for the color
attribute.

Here is an article I wrote many years ago  on encapsulation which is what accessor methods support.

Here are 5 constraints that you must include in your program.

1) Include an output statement at the beginning of the program with the assignment number and
your name:
2) The constructor must pass a single argument to initialize the color.
3) When the constructor is called, set the car’s initial color to Green. 
4) Include a loop to change the color until an “x” is entered.
5) Include a condition to test for the “x” and when found use a break to exit the loop.
6) Print “goodbye” upon exiting the program.

Test case: enter Red, Blue, x

### What to Submit ###
A single Java text file should be submitted to Blackboard.
